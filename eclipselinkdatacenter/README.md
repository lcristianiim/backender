# Database versioning
In the folder `database-versions` there is everything that needs to setup a database:
## structure.dbm
This file is generated by the pgmodeler. So it is recommended to handle the database structure using pgmodeler.
## data.sql
This file contains the data that can populate the database. This file can be easily used with the exposed adminier.
This file is obtained by running the `generate-inserts.sh` script
## persistence (folder)
This contains all the jpa entities and mappers needed. They should just be copied in the org.persistence.persistence package and everything should just work.
