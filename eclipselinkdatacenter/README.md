# Database versioning
In the folder `database-versions` there is everything that needs to setup a database:
## structure.dbm
This file is generated by the pgmodeler. So it is recommended to handle the database structure using pgmodeler.
## data.sql
This file contains the data that can populate the database. This file can be easealy used with the exposed adminier.
## persistence (folder)
This contains all the jpa entities and mappers needed. They should just be copied in the org.persistence.persistence package and everything should just work.
